# Multi-Search-Engine

This project aims to create a versatile search platform that combines the power of Google, Gemini, and Wikipedia APIs. It provides users with a seamless experience, allowing them to explore search results from various sources within a single interface. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

The Multi-Search-Engine application features a search bar where users can enter their queries. Once a query is submitted, the application utilizes the respective APIs of Google, Gemini, and Wikipedia to retrieve search results. These results are then presented to the user in a unified manner, allowing for easy comparison and exploration.

## Technologies Used

* HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the web page.
* JavaScript: Enables interactivity and dynamic functionalities within the web page, such as handling user input and fetching data from APIs.
